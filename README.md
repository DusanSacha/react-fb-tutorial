#My solution to [React Facebook Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) additional points

- Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
- Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
